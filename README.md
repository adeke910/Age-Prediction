# Age-Prediction-Model
Diversiboard TopCrowd- Data Science Intermediate I Challenge

## CHALLENGE OBJECTIVE

To Predict the target Age for each ID in the test set. The submission file should have a header and be formatted in a table as follows and include the Python code used :

ID     Yield

1      5.3

5      6.9

Etc..

 ## Data Characteristics
 
* "sex" - M, F, and I (infant).
* "length" - longest shell measurement.
* "diameter" - perpendicular to the length.
* "height" - measured with meat in the shell.
* "whole_wt" - whole abalone weight.
* "shucked_wt" - the weight of abalone meat.
* "viscera_wt" - gut-weight.
* "shell_wt" - the weight of the dried shell.
* "age" - the age of the abalone
